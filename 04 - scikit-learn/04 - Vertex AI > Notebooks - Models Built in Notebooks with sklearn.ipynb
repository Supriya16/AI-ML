    "# 04 - Vertex AI > Notebooks - Models Built in Notebooks with sklearn\n",
    "\n",
    "*This notebook was developed in collaboration with [statmike](https://github.com/statmike), basing much of the core code from existing notebooks and extending to new features. Notebook author: [goodrules](https://github.com/goodrules)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Where a model gets trained is where it consumes computing resources.  With Vertex AI, you have choices for configuring the computing resources available at training.  This notebook is an example of an execution environment.  When it was set up there were choices for machine type and accelerators (GPUs).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows training a model directly within the runtime of the notebook environment.  Then the model is saved and moved to GCS for deployment to a Vertex AI > Endpoint for online predictions.  The model training is done with [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and was designed to show a standard approach to logistic regression.  The training data batches are read from BigQuery using the [BigQuery Client](https://googleapis.dev/python/bigquery/latest/index.html).\n",
